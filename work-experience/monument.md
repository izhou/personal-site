Monument is a 24-unit live/work space in SF that connects and supports creative people across different fields. We provide affordable housing to a range of residents, from students, artists and performers, to engineers and CEOS. We run 400+ person events at sliding-scale for artists and nonprofits, supported by a growing volunteer community.

I curate and manage the residencies. I built the infrastructure for events, and often run them too.
