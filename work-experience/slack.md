Early member of the front-end engineering team. I developed many user-facing interfaces, including early iterations of the image gallery, user creation, and team creation flows. I joined the nascent growth team, working with data analysts on experiments to increase signup and conversions. I was team lead on our code base refactor into React and XHP. I was a proponent of fixing tech debt and drove the refactor of our PHP billing items and invoice framework, collaborating closely with accounting and customer experience.
