Clone of Workflowy, a hierarchical list creator to organize oneâ€™s thoughts. Uses Backbone and Marionette in the front end, and Ruby on Rails in the back end. The view is generated by recursively creating lists of forms. Keyboard shortcuts allow for quick navigation and rearrangement of each list. Parent and children relationships between entries update immediately upon creation or movement.
